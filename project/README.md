# TuneMantra Project Documentation

This directory contains project-level documentation for TuneMantra, including implementation plans, code evolution analyses, and project roadmaps.

## Contents

- [Codebase Comparison](codebase-comparison.md) - Analysis of codebase differences across development milestones ("branches"). Provides a detailed breakdown of how core components (database, auth, API, UI, key features like Blockchain/AI) evolved, and crucially, offers "Best Implementation Recommendations" by synthesizing the strongest aspects of different branches. This is key for defining the target system state.
- [Code Evolution Analysis](comprehensive-code-evolution.md) - A highly detailed, code-centric version of the "Codebase Comparison". It provides specific code snippets for database schema changes, authentication mechanisms (password handling, session management, permissions), blockchain integration (network config, gas optimization, rights registration, NFT minting), AI implementation (OpenAI GPT-4/4o usage, structured JSON responses, caching, fallbacks), audio processing (fingerprinting, quality analysis, batch processing), and rights management (dispute resolution workflows). This is invaluable for understanding the "how" of the recommended ideal backend.
- [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md) - A step-by-step strategy for implementing the "ideal" TuneMantra backend by merging the best features and code from various development branches, as identified in the preceding analysis documents. It details which specific code versions/approaches to use for schema, authentication, blockchain, AI, audio processing, rights management, and documentation style. This plan defines the target backend system for the "gem doc" and the new frontend.
